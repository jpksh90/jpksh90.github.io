## 👨‍💻 about me  

I will join the Maersk Mc-Kinney Møller Institute, SDU Software Engineering, Odense, as an Assistant Professor in January 2026.

My research vision is to develop scalable program analysis techniques for complex software systems. Modern software increasingly spans multiple programming languages and runtimes, yet most analysis tools reason about languages in isolation. This limits our ability to ensure security, correctness, and reliability in real-world systems.

My work focuses on cross-language program analysis, studying how data flow, control flow, and information-flow properties propagate across interlanguage boundaries. A key direction is the integration of static and dynamic analyses, combining the global guarantees of static reasoning with runtime evidence to improve precision, scalability, and explainability.

In parallel, I design industrial-strength analysis systems, informed by my work at OpenText, where I develop static analysis tools for large, security-critical codebases. This ensures that my research remains grounded in deployable, real-world constraints.

My Ph.D. at the University of Passau, supervised by Prof. Christian Hammer, established the foundations of this agenda through techniques for static analysis of interlanguage interoperations. My ongoing research extends this work toward hybrid static–dynamic analyses and runtime monitoring for modern, multi-language software ecosystems.
