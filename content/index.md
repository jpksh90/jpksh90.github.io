## 👨‍💻 about me  

I am currently part of OpenText India, where I design and develop advanced static analysis tools to detect and mitigate security vulnerabilities in complex software systems. My work sits at the intersection of software engineering, program analysis, and secure systems, blending theoretical precision with practical impact.  

My research explores the broader landscape of program analysis and language interoperability. I am particularly interested in how static and dynamic analyses can be combined to reason about information flow, interlanguage communication, and polyglot systems — modern software ecosystems where multiple programming languages seamlessly interact.  

Lately, my work has also been expanding toward dynamic analysis techniques for understanding runtime behavior and improving the reliability and security of multi-language applications.  
 
My Ph.D. at the [University of Passau](https://www.uni-passau.de), supervised by [Prof. Christian Hammer](https://www.fim.uni-passau.de/software-engineering-i/lehrstuhlteam/lehrstuhlinhaber?username=hammer50), explored the challenges of static analysis across language boundaries. In my dissertation, *Static Analysis of Interlanguage Interoperations* ([📖 Slides](assests/Slides.pdf) | [📘 Thesis](assests/thesis.pdf)), I developed techniques to reason about how programs written in multiple programming languages interact—particularly focusing on how data, control flow, and security properties propagate across these interlanguage boundaries. The research introduced methods to extend traditional static analyses to polyglot software systems, ensuring that developers can detect security vulnerabilities and correctness issues even when components are implemented in different languages or runtime environments.
